<p>
If you've ever been here before then you might have noticed that I have moved
my 'blog to <a href="http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/">pyBlosxom</a>. I did this as wordpress was a little large for my
needs, and didn't make it this easy to create a post, meaning I was wirting
less entries.
</p>
<p>
I have endevoured to keep the permalinks from my wordpress entries active for
those liks that were in a couple of pages.
</p>
<p>
Now I just need to make it look a bit cleaner and I'll be happy
