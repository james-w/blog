This was our dinner last night. There's nothing particularly original here,
but it was damn tasty. There are no pictures, so you'll have to take my word
that it looked great.

First chop the veg for roasting. Anything that roasts well will work. I used
sweet potato, squash and courgette. Stick it in the tray, with some oil,
garlic cloves, salt, pepper, and ground cumin and coriander. Put that in the
oven to roast and prepare the rest of the meal. When you remove it to serve
then stir in a large handful of roughly chopped coriander, it tastes great
and the green looks great with the orange of the veg.

Next prepare the lamb. Make patties from minced lamb, chopped fresh mint (half
the bunch), the juice of half a lemon, chopped red onion, and finely chopped
garlic with some spices: ground cinnamon, coriander, cumin, garam masala and
chilli powder. Grill or barbecue the patties (or make them in to kebabs if
you like).

Chop the other half of the mint, and add it and the juice from the rest of
the lemon to some fresh yoghurt. Then stir in a little maple syrup and a little
Cajun or jerk spice. Add only a little at first then add more to taste. You're
aiming for the sweetness and spice to be very subtle and to soften the yoghurt
flavour.

Serve with toasted pitta and shredded gem lettuce.
