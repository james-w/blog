Jerk Pork Burger with Green Apple Slaw
#parser reST

Thanks to `richb`_ I found `this recipe`_  for "Jerk Pork Burgers with
Green Apple Slaw", and they are fantastic. The Slaw is particularly good,
I'd really recommend you try it, even if it does sound a little weird.

Unfortunately, it appears as though "The Bell", a pub just round the
corner, no longer serves food. No matter how good a burger is, I'm sure
there's no way it could be as good as a Bell Burger. It seems I'm stuck
spending the rest of my days trying in vain to recreate that marvellous
piece of meat technology.
