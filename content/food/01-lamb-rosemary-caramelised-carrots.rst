I came up with this the other day. It's pretty rich and indulgent, but
not too hard to make. The lamb could perhaps do with something else, but
I can't think of anything at the moment.

  * 4 Lamb steaks
  * New Potatoes if in season, otherwise any small potato.
  * 4 Carrots
  * 2 Red onions
  * Bunch of rosemary
  * Garlic cloves
  * 2 glassed of red wine (a small bottle is fine). A good hearty one if possible
  * Gravy powder
  * Thyme (dried works fine)
  * A knob of butter
  * 3 Tablespoons Brown Sugar

If you can prepare the lamb the day before it will be better, but a couple
of hours is fine. Place the lamb steaks in a small container. Take a third
of the rosemary, and snap it a couple of times and place it in with the lamb.
Next bash open the garlic cloves (there's no need to peel them first) and add
them. Get your hands in there and rub both in to the meat, mixing it up. Next
add a glass of wine, cover and leave to marinate.

About an hour put some oil in a baking tray and place it in the oven to heat
up. Brush the potatoes clean then drop them in the hot oil, add some salt and
pepper and snap the remainder of the rosemary and drop that in. Put them back
in the oven.

Next brush the carrots clean (you can peel if you like), and chop them in to 
batons. Then quarter the two onions. Melt the butter in the frying pan over
a hot heat. Add the carrots and onion, and stir fry for a few minutes. Then
add the sugar and keep stirring. After a while you can turn the heat down
to a medium heat. Keep stirring regularly, as they will like to stick.

After about 15 minutes place the lamb under the grill on a medium heat. Make
up a serving of gravy in a saucepan, adding one more teaspoon of mixture than
suggested. Add the second glass of wine, and put on a low heat on the hob.

When the lamb is cooked to your satisfaction then remove the potatoes from the
oven and plate up. Next add the carrots and onions, and finally the meat. (I
like to stack the ingredients here). Finally tip the juice from the meat in
to the gravy and turn the heat right up and stir for one minute. Finally pour
a little gravy on each plate and serve.

Enjoy!
