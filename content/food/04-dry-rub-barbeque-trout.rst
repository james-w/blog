Made this up after buying a nice piece of locally caught freshwater trout.
I think that it would be even better if you were to hot-smoke it.
Apply the rub between two and twelve hours before cooking.

Mix up the following then rub on to the flesh of the fish (enough for
four servings):

  * 1 tbsp sea/rock salt.
  * 1 tbsp black peppercorns crushed.
  * 1 tbsp ground cumin.
  * 1 tbsp ground coriander.
  * 2 tsp caraway seed.
  * 2 tsp dried tarragon.
  * 2 tsp dried thyme.
  * 2 tsp chilli powder.
  * Zest of one lemon.

To drizzle on top when cooked melt some butter in a pan, add the
juice of the lemon you used above, a pinch of salt, one crushed clove
of garlic, and a handful of chopped coriander. Simmer for a couple of
minutes.

Enjoy!
