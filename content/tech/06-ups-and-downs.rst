I was thrilled this morning to finally come up with what I hope is a fix for a
`bug in ConsoleKit`_ that has been plauging a lot of users, judging by the number
of subscribers and duplicates on the `Ubuntu bug`_

.. _bug in ConsoleKit: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18046
.. _Ubuntu bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/consolekit/+bug/269651

I was happy to get upload fixes for various other bugs and sponsor some more from
other members of the community.

I was pleased to see a group of people to come together to prepare uploads for the
2.24.1 release of GNOME.

I enjoyed going to my favourite curry restaurant for lunch and listen to the stories
from my friend's trip to Malawi.

I was disappointed to read an article on the dailywtf.com today after I saw a pointer
to it.

I was saddened to read `this post`_ in response.

Carolyn, if on the off chance you read this post, I'm sorry that you feel that way.
I can only hope it doesn't end your involvement with our community, though I would
understand if it did, it can't be easy to be involved with a community which
makes you feel like that, no matter how infrequently. I can only promise that I
will try and discourage things I see which I feel are likely to provoke similar
reactions, and do my best to build communities that are welcoming. I also apologise
in advance for those times when I fall short.
