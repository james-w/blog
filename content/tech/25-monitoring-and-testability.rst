At UDS last week there was another "Testing in Ubuntu" session. During the
event I gave a brief presentation on monitoring and testability. The thesis
was that there are a lot of parallels between monitoring and testing, so many
that it's worth thinking of monitoring as a type of testing at times. Due to
that great monitoring requires a testable system, as well as thinking about
monitoring right at the start to build a monitorable system as well as a
testable one.

You can watch a video of the talk `here`_. (Thanks to the video team for
recording it and getting it online quickly.)

I have two main questions. Firstly, what are the conventional names for
the "passive" and "active" monitoring that I describe? Seecondly, do you
agree with me about monitoring?
