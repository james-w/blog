Summary: Tips for impressing in interviews

Recently I have been doing a lot of interviewing
([and we are still hiring](http://jetstack.io/careers)),
and I have seen a large difference in the interview skills of developers. There
have been great candidates have struggled to show that in interviews, and every
single candidate could have done more to stand out from the crowd.

I am talking to developers in this post, not because I'm going to be talking
specifically about answering software development questions, as there's a huge
variety in the questions that are asked, and there are plenty of posts and
books that already talk about that. Your technical knowledge is what it is, but
there are tips on interview technique that can help you better convince the
interviewer that you have the right set of skills for them. These techniques
likely apply beyond developers, but I am talking about what I know.

Always remember that you are always interviewing the company as well as them
interviewing you. By more fully engaging during the interview process you will
have more information to decide if you want to work there. Your circumstances
will dictate how much choice you have in that matter, but you should always
know what sort of company you are interviewing at.

# Before the interview

There are several things that you can do before the interview that will both
allow you to be better prepared, and to demonstrate that you are thoughtful,
motivated, and detail oriented.

## Ask some questions about the interview

Someone will be talking to you to schedule the interview, and the amount
of information they provide will vary widely. You want to ask for some more
information from them so that you are better aware of how the interview will
work, and what will be covered.

You should always make sure you understand some basic information:

* When the interview is
* Where is it? Do you have all the info needed to get there, or join if it is a
  video call?
* Who the interview is with. You want to understand how many people will be
  interviewing you, and find out their names and job titles.
* What the interview will cover. Some companies will give you a list of
  questions, but most will not. They should always be willing to tell you
  something though. I would be wary of interviewing somewhere that asked you to
  prepare for an interview that could be on any topic whatsoever. At the very
  least you should understand whether it is a technical interview or not.

Just avoid coming across as too pushy, or trying to get access to the answers,
limit yourself to one or two rounds of questions and most people will consider
that a good thing and answer, any more than that and you are risking coming
across as being pushy or lacking confidence.

## Prepare some questions

Every interview should end with the interviewers giving you a chance to ask
some questions. Often 10 minutes will be left at the end of the interview for
this. You don't want to be caught off guard at this point, as the interviewers
will be evaluating the questions that you ask.

There should be plenty of things that you want to know about the company, so
start by writing all of those down. Next identify the ones that can be answered
by information available online and get searching those answers. Asking about
something that is easily findable on the company website won't make you look
good, and you also don't want to waste your time asking about this so that you
can ask about the things that you can't find online. You want to do that
research now as it will better prepare you for the interview.

You should be left with a list of things that you want to know that can't be
found in a search engine. For each try to think of questions that would help
you understand that aspect of the company. Obviously you aren't always going to
be able to get a complete and clear answer to a straight question, but you can
think of questions that will give you some idea. For instance if you are
interested in work/life balance, you can ask "when was the last time that you
worked late?", or "when was the last time that your manager told you to take a
day off?"

Once you have a list of questions pick five that are tailored to the people
that you are speaking to. You will likely want to ask different questions to
future teammates, the hiring manager, the executive, HR, etc. You can ask
the same questions to multiple people, but try and avoid having a fixed set
of questions that you ask in every interview for the same company, as each time
you ask them you will learn less.

By asking good questions you will both learn more about the company, but also
come across as a candidate that is thoughtful and very interested in the role.
I'm always a little disappointed when a candidate has zero questions at the end
of an interview.

## Prepare some answers

You should also spend some time thinking about the answers that you are going
to give in the interview. You probably don't know the questions that they
are going to ask, but the recon that you did earlier will give you some ideas.
You know:

* What they say the subject of the interview is
* Who the interviewers are
* What the job description says
* What the company does

By putting these together you should be able to guess some of the topics that
will be covered, and maybe the sorts of questions they will ask about that
topic.

If you know that you are meeting with the lead of the db team, then expect some
database questions. If the role says that a responsibility of the job will be
automated testing of a data pipeline, then expect some questions about
automated testing of data pipelines. If the company uses Ruby to manage IoT
devices then expect some questions about Ruby and IoT protocols.

Of course your guesses won't all be correct, but you will be close on some of
the things, and the process of thinking about it will be useful either way.

Once you have your list of topics and/or questions you can think about
experience you have with those things. It's rare that an interview asks
entirely about factual things, and there will almost always be questions about
your experience with a topic, so already having thought about which stories
from your past may be appropriate should avoid your mind going blank at the
crucial moment.

This applies to non-technical interviews as well. You can think about
experiences related to demonstrating leadership, resolving conflict etc. and
have those stories ready if asked about those topics.

# During the interview

Once you get in the interview there are several bits of interview technique
that will help you to demonstrate your skills. A very common problem is failing
to understand how to shape the interview and your answers to demonstrate a
well-rounded skill-set and experience.

## Expect a brief chat at the beginning

Expect there to be some small talk at the start of the interview, particularly
when dealing with multiple interviewers as they may not arrive at the same
time.

You want the interviewer to like you and see themselves working with you, and
this will have a large impact on that. Unfortunately it may also be the point
in the interview when you are most nervous, so having something prepared may
be a good idea.

Go in to the interview with a question or two that you can use at this point.
You can ask about anything, such as the weather, the commute, lunch, or their
role, or some relevant news story. Ideally you should be able to engage in a
brief chat that helps put you at ease.

Sometimes you will find that the chat at the beginning seems to be going on
far too long. This could be for two reasons. Firstly that you have engaged
someone that talks a lot in to an interesting conversation. In that case
try and let the conversation come to a natural close pretty quickly, for
instance following up to the next thing they say with "yeah, it's a very
interesting topic" and then pausing to provide a break to move on to the
interview. If that doesn't work it may be because you have found yourself
in the second case, which is where the interviewer is going for a conversational
style interview, where they just start a conversation and see where it leads.
If you think that's the case then try and get your brain out of small talk mode
and in to interview mode and start trying to shape your answers using the
rest of these tips.

## Give well-rounded answers

Each question the interviewer asks has two purposes:

1. a specific question that they want to get the answer to
2. a placeholder for a topic that they want to discuss with you

In giving your answers you need to address both of these at the same time,
which can be tricky, but can come quite naturally with some practice.

The first thing you want to do in response to a question is think. You need
to pause to let this happen, so don't jump straight in. Some people take a
sip of water, some say "let me think..."

In this period ask yourself two questions:

1. What does the interviewer want to hear?
  * They will have some particular things that they will be listening out for,
    can you work out what they are?
2. What do I want them to know about this topic?
  * As well as answering their question it's also an opportunity to tell them
    about some of your skills or experience. What seems important for them to
    hear at this point. For instance as well as answering their question you
    might want to show that you have a deeper understanding.

As you are doing this you may realise that you don't really understand what
they are looking for, in which case you should clarify the question. Don't
be afraid to do this, and it's actually a marker of someone that communicates
well. You can ask them to repeat if you didn't hear, rephrase if you don't really
understand, or clarify if there's a point that doesn't seem clear.

Once you know what you want to talk about then structure your answer. There
is some real skill in doing this well, so having some mock interviews
can really help. You want to concisely answer their question while also
showing that you know a bit more than that.

One of the best answers a candidate ever gave me was in an interview where we
had been discussing the code of a personal project they had worked on.  I asked
"what would be the next change you would want to make to this code?" They
answered by listing some of the changes that they would want to make and why.
They wrapped up their answer by saying "...but you asked me what was the
**next** change I want to make to this project, and that would be [...] because
it would make all of the other changes easier and safer."

This was a fantastic answer because it showed:

* That they have lots of ideas for improvement
* That they listened to and understood the question
* That they had thought about the priority of the changes, and why one would be
  good to do before the rest

This is a great example of both answering the question and saying what the
interviewer wants to hear, as well as being able to show some more depth behind
the answer, wrapped up with excellent communication skills.

## Experience beats knowledge

Someone that has experience with a topic is generally preferable to someone
that only knows about it in theory, so when possible you should tie your answer
back to some experience you have had.

A good technique for this is to start the answer with your specific experience,
and then talk about what you would do differently next time, as this allows
you to demonstrate that you learned from the experience and would be able to
apply that.

The only danger is if you have the same example for every question. If you are
just starting out your career that is fine. If you are not then try and have
some variety, though drawing more from the most recent examples makes sense
as that will be when you knew the most, as well as it being fresher in your memory.

## Don't overlook the simple stuff

One trap people fall in to is overlooking the simple things, they always
want to dazzle with their knowledge, but there are two problems with this.

Firstly the thing that you think is simple may be exactly the point that
the interviewer is looking for you to make. By skipping over it the interviewer
thinks that you don't know the answer.

Secondly, trying to dazzle isn't all that effective as it can look like you
are trying to show off, which people generally don't want in a colleague.
The best developers I have interviewed were able to quickly and simply
communicate the simple answers and move on to deeper things. This is usually
a good tactic when constructing answers. You give the simple answer and
phrase it really well, and then start unpicking the complications and
talking about them. The interviewer can then move on when they feel that
they have heard enough.

## Tie your answers back to the role

You know something about the company and the role that you have applied for,
so you should be able to make some reference to what you would do if you
were working in that role.

This can be things like saying "I guess that in your industry latency is critical,
so I would make a different decision in that case," or "I learned from that
how to troubleshoot gRPC services, and I would be able to bring that skill to
this role."

The only thing to be careful of here is telling the interviewers how to do
their job. Make your statements hypothetical, or make it clear that you are guessing
about the constraints that they have.

## Don't be afraid to say that you don't know

A big danger is trying to pretend you know something that you don't. You can
very quickly get caught in this, and it does not reflect well on you.

Once you are pushing past your area of knowledge then don't be afraid to say
that you don't know.

You don't have to stop at that point though, you can try and demonstrate that
while you don't know something for sure, you still understand some of the context.

One option is to ask the interviewer something. This works best for something
simple, e.g. you can't remember whether Prometheus uses push-based or pull-based
collection because you haven't used it yourself. You can ask for clarification
and then continue from there. Most interviewers will be fine with this as
you demonstrated that you understood the difference, and just couldn't remember
a simple fact, but were able to recover.

The other option is to switch to hypothetical mode. You can say something like
"I don't know how that system works, but I think if it's based on X then it would
handle that by ..." Don't go too far down this path, but it's a way to avoid just
saying "I don't know" and show that you understand some of the concepts.

## Pacing

In some ways this is the hardest skill here. It's in your best interest that
the interviewer makes it through all of their questions, but you also don't
want to finish early and not have as much time to sell yourself. This is
hard as you don't know what is coming.

It's also tricky as interviewers have different styles. There are some people
that ask a question and listen to your answer, then move on to the next question.
There are others that want to make the interview more conversational and ask the
first part of a question and then want to ask a follow-up based on your answer.
It's important to try and figure out which type of interviewer you have. If you
give short answers to the first type then the interview will be over very
quickly. If you give long answers to the second then the interview will drag on,
but also they won't feel that the conversation was very fluid, and that's something
that this type of interviewer will usually be grading on.

My advice for doing this is to answer the first question in a pretty straightforward,
to-the-point manner. Don't rush, but don't spend lots of time on digressions and
details. If the interviewer moves on to the next question then they are likely
going to continue in that fashion, so focus a bit more on fleshing out your answers
to say the things that you want to convey to the interviewer. If they instead
ask a followup then you likely have a more conversational style interviewer and you
should give opportunity for the interviewer to ask followups and have a conversation.

Overall try and keep half an eye on the time, and also on the demeanour of the
interviewer.  If they are looking rushed then try and speed up a bit and hit
more directly on the main points you want to make. If there seems to be plenty
of time left then you should expand on your answers a bit more.

In a typical hour-long interview there will be 10 minutes for questions at the
end, so you should have the 45 minute mark in your mind as the wrap up point
for the questions.

If all else fails then you can ask the interviewer how you are doing for time.

If you do find that you have finished the interview super early then feel free
to say something like "Now that I've had a little more time to think about it
there's something I would like to add to my answer about X, could we go back
to that please?" to allow you some more time to demonstrate your knowledge.

# Summary

My main points of advice would be:

* Preparation is important to a great interview
* You are interviewing the company as well as them interviewing you, so ask
  good questions
* Think about what the interviewer wants to hear, and what you want them to
  know about you, and try and structure your answer to do both these things at
  once.
