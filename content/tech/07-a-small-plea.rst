A small plea

I have a small request to make. When writing a changelog entry please
remember you are writing it for other people to read as well. Please
document why you are doing something in enough detail that I can work
it out later on.

A changelog is not just for describing what you changed, it should be
for describing what you changed and why you changed it.

Just documenting what was changed is not that helpful, as I can simply
look at the diff to see that. What I can't get from the diff is what
was in your head at the time, the motivation, the reasons why you chose
that solution, the stuff that I care about when I am looking at the
change.

Oh, and one more thing, your immediate motivation may not be the one
that I care about. "Because somebody told me to" isn't the reason that
will help me understand the change.

Thanks in advance,

James
