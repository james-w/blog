Priciples are incredibly powerful and valuable. They translate our values
in to guidance of how to build something. Values are important, but
they don't point to how to do something. For instance writing secure
code is important, but simply saying to someone "write more secure
code" doesn't help them all that much. Instead you can teach them
principles that will guide them, such as least privilege or defence
in depth.

They can also be more powerful than processes/tools etc. If someone
tells you to use a specific process to do something, but that
process doesn't seem to be working, it can be hard for you to know
how to change it, you need to understand the rationale behind the
process to effectively evolve it.

An example of this would be project management processes. You could
implement Scrum without fully understanding how it came to be.
Sooner or later though it will need to change, as it won't be
effective in all situations, nothing can be. You can do the
research, and seek other ways to achieve the same goals. An
alternative approach would be LEAN, which doesn't prescribe
any particular processes, and focuses on the principles instead.
You can evolve a process that suits you based on the principles,
but if you simply teach that process, then you are back in
the same position.

Vision and values are important, but can be too abstract to
guide day-to-day work. Processes and tools are useful, but
are too rigid. Principles link the two, allowing people some
freedom to innovate, while steering towards the the values and
vision. When we find a principle that works, we need to focus
on that, and avoid values without implementation, or process
without understanding.
