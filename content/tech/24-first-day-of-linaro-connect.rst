Today is the first day of the `Linaro Connect`_ in Cambridge. Linaro has
gathered to spend a week talking, coding and having fun.

The Infrastructure team is spending most of the week coding, on a few
select topics, chosen to make good use of the time that we have together.

In order to help us focus on our goals for the week I've put together
a hard copy version of `status.linaro.org`_.

We'll be updating it during the week as we make progress. I'll report
back on how it looks at the end of the week.
