So after I had such a <a
href="http://jameswestby.net/weblog/tech/00-rt2500-nightmare.html">problem</a> 
with my rt2500 based card, I ordered an rt61 based one. It arrived this
morning, and it works. Here's what I did to get it to work.
</p>

<p>
First download the <a
href="http://rt2x00.serialmonkey.com/wiki/index.php/Downloads">
cvs snapshot</a> driver. The beta release one doesn't work, and you shouldn't
try it. Untar it and go in to the Module subdir. Then run make. The make
install looked a little dodgy to me, so I copied the driver across and ran
depmod.
</p>

<blockquote><p>
# cp rt61.ko /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/net/wireless/
# depmod -a. 
</p></blockquote>

<p>
Then grab the the firmware from <a
href="http://www.ralinktech.com/supp-1.htm">RaLink</a> and unzip the files in
to /lib/firmware. 
</p>

<p>
Then add the alias
</p>

<blockquote><p>
# echo "alias ra0 rt61" >> /etc/modprobe.conf
</p></blockquote>

<p>
The interface will be called ra0, so change any config files (e.g.
/etc/network/interfaces) to reflect this. You should then be able to ifup ra0
and have the interface work. Good luck!
