Debian tips wiki started
#parser reST

I have decided to start a wiki that I am calling `Debian tips`_ where I can 
drop notes about neat things I find to do, and instructions on how to set 
things up. (A rip-off of `Debian Administration`_ basically).

.. _Debian tips: http://jameswestby.net/tips/
.. _Debian Administration: http://www.debian-administration.org/

It wont be entirely Debian related, as I will sometimes put instructions for
installing from source when I put something on my (non-Debian) server. 

It is partly so that I can record things for my own benefit later, but feel
free to register and add your own tips, or add notes to mine.
