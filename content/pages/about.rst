About
#####

I am a developer currently living in the UK. You can find
occasional writing here or on twitter (link in the sidebar).

I am interested in technology, and particularly how systems
of people create that technology.

I am comfortable in many areas of software, but have most
experience building developer tools and server-side software
in Python.

I have a lot of open source experience, and publish a lot
of my own code.
