Looking for Summer of Code students
#parser reST

As you've probably heard by now, `Ubuntu has been accepted to Google Summer of Code
this year.`_ We're currently at the point where we are looking for students to
take part and the mentors to pair with them to make the proposal. We have some `ideas
on the wiki`_, but there's nothing to stop you coming up with your own if you have a
great idea. The only requirement is that you find a mentor to help you with it.

.. _Ubuntu has been accepted to Google Summer of Code this year.: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GoogleSoC2010
.. _ideas on the wiki: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GoogleSoC2010/Ideas

The best way to do this is to write up a proposal on your wiki page on the Ubuntu wiki,
and then to email the `Ubuntu Summer of Code mailing list` about it. You can also
ask for possible mentors on IRC and on other Ubuntu mailing lists related to your idea.

I have a couple of ideas on the wiki page, but I am happy to consider ideas from
students that fall in my area of expertise.

I spend most of my time working on developer tools and infrastructure. These are
things that users of Ubuntu won't see, but are used every day by developers of
Ubuntu. Improvements we can make in this area can in turn improve Ubuntu by giving
us happier, more productive, developers. It's also an interesting area to work in,
as there are usually different constraints to developing user software, as developers
have different demands.

If you think that sounds interesting and you have a great idea that falls in to that
area, or you like one of my ideas on the wiki page, then get in touch with me. I will
be happy to discuss your ideas and help you flesh them out in to a possible proposal,
but I won't be able to mentor everyone.

I would consider mentoring any idea that either improved existing tools used by
Ubuntu developers (bzr, pbuilder, devscripts, ubuntu-dev-tools, etc.)
or created a new one that would make things easier. In the same spirit, anything
that makes it easier for someone to get started with Ubuntu development, such as
Harvest, helpers for creating packages, etc. could be a possible project. The last
category would be infrastructure-type projects such as the idea to automate
test-merging-and-building of new upstreams, or similar ideas.

I've also posted about some ideas that I would like to see previously on my blog,
which might be a source of inspriation.

If this interests you then you can find out how to contact me on my `Launchpad profile.`_
