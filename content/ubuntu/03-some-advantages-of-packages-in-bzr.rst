Some advantages of having packages in Bazaar

After some discussions in the last week or so I decided to finally
get around to something that I have been promising for ages: making
a screencast about what is good about having packages in bzr. It's
basically just me rambling for almost 20 minutes, so don't expect
anything slick or compelling. Also, I have to apologies for
speaking too quickly and for the skips in the audio. I'll improve
this for next time.

If there are areas that you would like me to go in to in more detail
in this format then leave a comment and I'll see what I can do. As
usual feel free to grab me if you would like to discuss anything,
and there are lots of interesting things that could be prototyped
if you are in to that.

I'm not sure where else to put this so that those who don't read
planet could find out about it. It doesn't seem like something that
should be sent to a mailing list, and just dropping a note on IRC
isn't that reliable. Any suggestions would be welcome.
