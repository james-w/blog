Banshee as the default mediaplayer?
#parser reST

Jo Shields `posts about his intention to propose switching Rhythmbox for
Banshee`_ in Karmic. (I'm trying to convince him to apply to be a MOTU,
or at least an Ubuntu member, so he can be on Planet Ubuntu.) 
He's not the first to suggest it, but he is in the right place to make
the proposal for this release.

I'm personally quite happy with Rhythmbox, and haven't really tried
Banshee, though for my use I imagine they are pretty similar. (Two
things that would be definite benefits for me would be remembering
what I was doing when I closed it when it starts, and understanding
mix CDs better). I can certainly understand some of the arguments
for switching as well, so I wouldn't be against it.

There is `an idea on Brainstorm about this`_, and while Brainstorm
can't capture the intricacies of the debate, it suggests that Rhythmbox
is quite popular with the people that voted (though it's not clear
how many had tried the alternatives.)

This post isn't really to argue one way or the other, or to attempt
to cover all the criteria by which a decision will be made. My point is
to emphasise that the Banshee developers have done themselves a great
favour in this debate by making one aspect of switching easier. The
have implemented `importing from Rhythmbox`_. This means that any
switch wouldn't mean that all users had to re-import their collection.

That's not everything that is involved in switching, and indeed, many
of the issues around trying to change a default don't have good answers,
and that's something we should work to improve as a community.

You don't have to spend time implementing importers for every
similar application out there, but easing migration from commonly
used apps can help users switch, and is a big benefit when trying
to switch a large number of users painlessly. Also, while importing
is useful, it's not the ideal solution. A common storage format,
and shared storage would be superior in many ways for this purpose.
