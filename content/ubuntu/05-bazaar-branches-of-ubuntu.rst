Bazaar branches of Ubuntu
#parser reST

This morning I `announced`_ the availability of bzr branches for
every source package in Ubuntu.

.. _announced: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2008-November/000514.html

This is exciting, and I hope the first step in revolutionising
the way we develop Ubuntu. I believe it will lead to an increase in
efficiency, and give us interesting new ways to collaborate.

There's a long way to go yet though, this is just the first milestone.
Over the next few development cycles we will be improving the branches
themselves so you can work more effectively with people outside Ubuntu
using them, as well as improving the tools to help us use them,
and many things we haven't thought of yet.

I'd like to thank the Bazaar developers for the tool that all of this
is built on, as well as Robert Collins, Colin Watson who helped massively
with this project, and our hard working sysadmins who keep everything
running smoothly.
