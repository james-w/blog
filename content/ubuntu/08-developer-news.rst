Developer News
#parser reST

The second installment of `Developer News`_ went `out on Monday`_, and boy was it
hard work. It's great to see so much going on, but it does make preparing the
summary time consuming. Thanks a lot to `Stefan Lesicnik`_ for his help in preparing
this one. As well as having more to report I also broadened the intended audience
this month.

For the first month the intended audience was just Ubuntu developers, so I didn't
include anything from ubuntu-devel-announce, as I assumed that everyone would
already have seen those announcements. The first issue was picked up by both the
fridge and LWN though, so it was more widely read, and showed there was an interest
in having more news for external people. Therefore I wrote this edition to include
those people as well.

I'm pretty sure that there was plenty more that we could have included as well, it's
just I didn't know about it, or there was nothing to link to. I think we need to do a
better job as a community to communicate what we are doing. My process was simply to
trawl the archives looking for announcements and discussions of things, so all anyone
had to do was write one email.

Therefore I think we have two problems to solve, firstly getting everything that is
going on announced in the right places, and secondly making it easier to summarise
all of the activity.

I hope that the first will become more a part of our culture, and the Developer News
will help by getting more exposure for those who do communicate about what they are
doing.

I'm not too sure how to improve the second though. We have a defined process for submitting
items for the news, but to date there have been no submissions using that process,
and one submission by editing the wiki page as I was preparing the second issue.
Why is this? Why have you not submitted anything? Is it that you didn't know about
the process? Is it too much work? Is it that you never think to use it? That you are
not sure that your item counts? That you are not sure that someone else hasn't alread
submitted it?

The feedback I have got about the Developer News has been both frequent and entirely
positive, so I believe it is a valuable service that should be carried on, but I
fear that the current way of doing it won't really scale. I don't think it would be
worth a day of my time a month to complete it.

Any suggestions for improving the situation would be appreciated.
