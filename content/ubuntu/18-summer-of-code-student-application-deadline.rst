Summer of Code Student Application Deadline
#parser reST

The deadline for students to submit their applications to Google for Summer
of Code is imminent.

If you were waiting for the last minute to submit, that is now!

If you are mentor and have the perfect student you have been working with,
check with them that they have submitted the application to Google, otherwise
you will be stuck.

Next week we'll start to process the huge number of applications that we
have for Ubuntu.
