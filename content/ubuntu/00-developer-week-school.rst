MOTU School sessions for Ubuntu Developer Week wanted
#parser reST

Next month we have another Ubuntu Developer Week. It's still
in the planning stage, and there will be a proper announcement
later, so if you are interested in attending wait for that.

This post is for those who are in a position to give sessions.
I want to get several MOTU School sessions included in the schedule,
but for that I need presenters willing to give them.

There's a list of some ideas for sessions at

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU/School/Requests

as always. If there is a session there that you would like to give
then get in touch with me. It doesn't have to be one from that
list, I'm interested in any session that you are willing and
able to present.

In particular I'm really keen to see the sessions on Java this time.
I'll speak to the Soyuz team to see if they are willing to present
a session, as that one has several votes. I'll also probably
present a bzr session with David, and a packaging with bzr session.

If you want to have a session during the week on something then
stick your name and the title on

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDeveloperWeek/Prep

or grab dholbach or me to discuss it.

Speaking of dholbach, let's make this developer week ROCK!

I'll leave you with Eugene O'Neill::

  There is no present or future,
  only the past happening over and over again,
  now.
