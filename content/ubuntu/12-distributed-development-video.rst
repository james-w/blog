Distributed Development Video
#parser reST

I recently gave a talk to some fellow Canonical employees about where we are
with the "Distributed Development" project. For that I made a screencast showing
some of the Launchpad Codehosting features that you can now use for Ubuntu. Thanks
to the Launchpad team for making this happen. We're still ironing out the
remaining kinks that make it a pain to use, and getting all the packages imported,
but it's possible to use them now.

The screencast has no audio unfortunately, but you can `watch it`_ and try and
guess what I was saying. There's `documentation available on the wiki`_ as well.

One of the things the video shows is how to request someone review your change,
i.e. how to get a change sponsored in to Ubuntu. I'm keen to have people test this,
as it's not something I do very often now that I am a core-dev. Therefore if
you want to help test then propose a merge and set the appropriate sponsor
team as the reviewer, and I will prioritise it and you can give me feedback in
return.

Note that a bug in Launchpad means that I won't get a notification when they are
created, so feel free to drop me a line via email or on IRC until that bug is
fixed next month. I'll continue to poll the lists though, so nothing will get
dropped.
