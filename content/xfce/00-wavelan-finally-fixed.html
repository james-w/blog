<p>
After I got a working wireless card I was finally able to fix the
xfce4-wavelan plugin. After I had ported it to the Xfce 4.4 API it stopped
working on a lot of systems. I don't think that I caused this, I think it was
more the recompilation against updated wireless stack in the kernel that was
what highlighted it.
</p>

<p>
The fix was quite simple in the end. I looked at the source of wireless-tools,
and came up with this diff.

<blockquote><p>
-  wreq.u.data.length = 0;<br />
+  wreq.u.data.length = sizeof(struct iw_statistics);
</p></blockquote>

It seems some implementations interpreted the 0 as some large number or
similar, most took it to mean 0, and returned E2BIG. Setting it to the size of
the returned object allowed it to work.
</p>

<p>
Until I get a goodies account sorted out then I will host the release at
<a href="http://jameswestby.net/debian/">http://jameswestby.net/debian/</a>,
including some unofficial Debian packages.
</p>

<p>
[Update: I have just release 0.5.2 as well, this fixes the other bugs that I
wanted to. Only one left that I know about (stats slightly wrong sometimes,
but I don't know if that can be helped).]
