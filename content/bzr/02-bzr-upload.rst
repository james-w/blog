bzr-upload


On Friday `bzr-upload`_ was officialy `announced`_. In the blog
announcement Martin tells the story of how this plugin was born. I'm
proud to say "I was there!". I was sat at the table with them that
evening as they discussed what was wanted, and what was possible. This
was just one of the great things about the last sprint for me, and I was
only there for two days.

Very often on the #bzr IRC channel we have users asking why bzr doesn't
update the working tree on a remote machine, and what they can do about
this. Very often it turns out that they are web developers who are looking
to deploy a website, rather than just host the branch, and so the
normal behaviour is kind of the opposite of what they want.

John wrote the `push-and-update`_ plugin to help with this, but it
didn't fulfil all the needs, and requires ssh access, where web developers
sometimes only have ftp access.

While bzr-upload does have some corner cases to be wary of, it's a great thing
to have available. If you are web developer who is looking for a version
control system for your code then consider bzr, it will hopefully suit
your workflow very well.

Now, watch out for Martin's improvements to `loggerhead`_, and Vincent's
improvements to his kitchen.
