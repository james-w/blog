08/2006::Halfway through::Security Engineering::0471389226::Ross Anderson::So
	far, so good. Still going over the basics, but he presents them well,
	with a couple of insights as well.
07/2007::Finished::GB 84::0571221742::David Peace::Angry, angry, angry. A mix
	of fact and fiction that looks at the UK miner's strike of 1984. It uses
	the stories of several different characters to examin some of the issues
	of the conflict by examing small parts of it from different angles. I don't
	know enough about the subect, so I was keen to learn more, especially as it
	is partially set around the area where I grew up. I was generally
	unstatisfied though, while I did learn about the issues I found that the
	writing tended to grate with me. The story of one character, a miner, told
	in a very interesting style, using his voice, but written in a style similar
	to newspaper columns, with a stream of conciousness feel, was genuinely
	touching in places.
0?/2007::Finished::Spoken Here::009946022X::Mark Abley::An interesting journey
	studying many endangered languages, looking at the many factors that have
	contributed to their decline, and the efforts to save them. It also presents
	a good case for supporting the diversity of languages, and why English
	becoming the dominant language, while convenient, may be stifling much more
	than other languages.
03/2007::Finished::Yes Man::0091896746::Danny Wallace::Finshed it for the
	second time. A great laugh. The Amsterdam bit is the funniest thing
	I've ever read, gaining me some funny looks on the train.
02/2007::Finished::Ghostwritten::0340739754::David Mitchell::Very well
	told set of stories that link together beautifully. They are very
	disjoint in style and content, but the overall theme pulls them
	together, and he really explores the theme well with this device.
11/2006::Finished::In Cold Blood::0140274189::Truman Capote::A very interesting
	read. A very different book to most, and from that perspective very worthwile.
11/2006::Finished::The Place at the End of the World: Stories from the Frontline::0747580367::Janine di Giovanni::A
	collection of her writings from various conflict situations around the world.
	She combines some very good writing, with some great stories, and each of the
	conflicts she reports on needs to be learned about. She beautifully exposes
	some of the greater issues involved with the small stories she tells, each of
	which engages you with the suffering of the people, making it very emotional.
	She is absolutely my hero now, for going in to these places in the first
	place, and then coming out of them and writing in such an engaging and
	revealing way.
08/2006::Finished::To Kill a Mockingbird::0099419785::Harper Lee::This is what
	kept me entertained on the way back from Edinburgh. A classic, I know,
	but I actually knew little about it, except for the briefest of
	outlines. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and was surprised by the
	perspective chosen, and the content of most of the book. I wish I had
	been given this as a text in school, i think it might have been more
	interesting than the books that I did study, though that might have
	ruined it for me.
08/2006::Finished::An Artist of the Floating World::0571209130::Kazuo Ishiguro::
	Read this on the train from Birmingham to Edinburgh, as it
	is not too thick. It was truly excellent, with many different themes
	running all the way through. It had the property that I seem to find
	in all of his books, where the pace is slow, and it seems simple on 
	the surface, but it triggers so many ideas in your mind as you read
	you have trouble holding on to them. When a thought does manage to
	fight it's way to the top and crystalise, it is gone just as quick, 
	leaving just the sensation of a profound insight, but often with the 
	details as blurry as they were. Truly cemented Ishiguro as my
	favourite author at the moment, I find his subtle power and strong
	imagery untouchable.
08/2006::Finished::Midnight's Children::0099578514::Salman Rushdie::
	One big chunk of book. Glad I read it, particularly for what I learnt
	about the history of the subcontient. I can't say I enjoyed all that much
	though.
11/2007::Finished::Fahrenheit 451::0007181701::Ray Bradbury::
	Read this after seeing a pretty bad performance of it at Edingburgh last
	year. It's pretty good, but certainly not the best dystopian novel.
11/2007::Finished::The Interesting Narrative, and Other Writings::0142437166::Olaudah Equiano::
	Pretty interesting stuff, part examination of the slave trade, part adventure.
	He is an intruguing character. Pretty tough going sometimes, and crushed
	under the weight of all of the footnotes.
10/2006::Finished::Nature via Nurture::1841157465::Matt Ridley::
	He very quickly makes it clear that his position is that development is
	influenced by nature and nurture, and moves on to examining how each
	of the influenced varies, and what this leads to. It is all the better
	book for it. A very interesting read.
02/2008::Finished::Lolita::0141182539::Vladimir Nabokov::
	Very skillful writing means that the subject matter of the book is
	examined without being judgemental. Well worth a read.
12/2007::Finished::Black Swan Green::0340822805::David Mitchell::
	Absolutely amazing. Precisely like being a 13 year old boy. A fabulous book.
02/2008::Finished::No One Belongs Here More Than You::1841959308::Miranda July::
	A collection of short stories. Well worth a read. Some of them blew me away.
10/2007::Finished::A Million Little Pieces::0719561027::James Frey::
	Brilliant. I have never been so moved by a book. I don't care how much
	is friction, and while the style didn't annoy me; I found it very powerful.
?/2006::Finished::Never Let Me Go::057122413X::Kazuo Ishiguro::
	Haunting and touching. I really enjoyed it.
02/2007::Finished::Cosmos::0349107033::Carl Sagan::
	The best book on space I've read, and still very relevant today.
01/2008::Finished::The God of Small Things::0006551092::Arundhati Roy::
	A wonderful book with many different themes. One paragraph blew me away
	with the writing skill it exhibited.
07/2008::Finished::My Friend Leonard::0719561175::James Frey::
	Excellent follow up to "A Million Little Pieces." Doesn't quite hit
	those heights, but it is still very moving.
05/2008::Finished::The Human Mind::0553816195::Robert Winston::
	An excellent book. There were plenty of points where I would have liked
	more detail, but it couldn't have been the book it is if my wish had
	been fulfiled.
06/2007::Finished::Bloody Foreigners::0349115664::Robert Winder::
	Very interesting history. I hadn't realised quite how much influence
	some of the influxes to this country had had.
04/2008::Finished::The Catcher in the Rye::0582772729::J. D. Salinger::
	I enjoyed it, but I felt like I missed something. This was another one
	that I think I would have liked to study in school.
05/2008::Finished::The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time::0099450259::Mark Haddon::
	Really good book. Very short, but excellent. He portrays the character
	very well.
10/2007::Finished::The Remains of the Day::0571225381::Kazuo Ishiguro::
	Not my favourite of his, but still readable. The ambiguity of the central
	character reminded me of "An Artist of the Floating World", but I found that
	more powerful.
?/2006::Finished::The Road to Wigan Pier::0141185295::George Orwell::
	Very interesting book. Both learning about the world that he is visiting,
	and seeing the way that he views that world.
08/2007::Finished::Every Light in the House Burnin'::074724653X::Andrea Levy::
	Very enjoyable read. I found "Small Island" to be a better book, but this was
	still worth the time.
09/2007::Finished::The Girl Who Played Go::009949079X::Shan Sa::
	A beautiful book. My copy has no crease down the spine, as the book felt so delicate
	and I didn't want to damage it.
05/2007::Finished::Touching From a Distance::0571224814::Deborah Curtis::
	I really enjoyed this. It's a fascinating biography. Well worth a read if you
	enjoyed the film, there is plenty more in here.
06/2007::Finished::Cloud Atlas::0340822783::David Mitchell::
	For most of the book I couldn't work out if it was too gimmicky, but the last couple
	of chapters really swung it for me. It does lay it on a bit thick at times, but there
	are some real high points.
11/2007::Finished::All of these people::0007176937::Fergal Keane::
	Really good biography. A really interesting life, with some a personal side that is
	very moving.
08/2008::Finished::Disgrace::0099289520::J. M. Coetzee::
	Amazing book. I can see why it won the awards that it did.
07/2008::Finished::Half of a Yellow Sun::0007200285::Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie::
	Really enjoyed this one. It's very interesting, moving and well-written.
08/2008::Finished::Things Fall Apart::0141186887::Chinua Achebe::
	A great book. Very powerful, and extremely interesting.
08/2008::Finished::Exit A::1416527559::Anthony Swofford::
	Disappointing. It has its moments, but not enough to carry it. Not recommended.
09/2008::Finished::Life of Pi::184195392X::Yann Martel::
	Very good book. Interesting and suspenseful.
