A long anticipated release
#parser reST

Now that one `important release`_ is out the way it's time to look forward
to another one. This has been long anticipated, and will probably decide
whether they go on to great new heights, or are just remembered for their
previous contributions, but aren't considered relevant any more.

No, I'm not talking about the `Fedora release`_, that is definitely relevant,
and is sure to be great. I'm talking about the release of "Third", the
new album from `Portishead`_. Fingers crossed it's going to live up to
the legacy.

Oh, and if you don't know, get to know.
