I love a bad book

Last night I finished reading "Exit A" by Anthony Swofford. I had decided
a while ago that I didn't like it, but it wasn't so bad that I had to put
it down, so I stuck with it to the end. It wasn't a bad book, it was just
poor in places, and disappointing overall.

I did prefer the act of reading the book to the book itself though.
I have just read 10 or 20 draw-droppingly good books in a row. The
previous book was "Disgrace" by J. M. Coetzee, which is stunning.
Read it. I was beginning to think that I just possibly enjoyed most
books a lot. Reading a book I didn't enjoy showed me that I just
read a `lot of good books`_.

I saw this one as a new release in a bookshop, and it had a piece of
card with it, written by one of the members of staff in the shop.
The card said something like "Swofford could have been forgiven for
writing a poor second book, but he doesn't need to be, he can really
write." I agree for the most part, he certainly could have been
forgiven, and this book isn't bad enough that he really needs to
be. It however not a great book, unlike "Jarhead", which I haven't
changed my opinion on.

It wasn't just the act of reading a mediocre book that buoyed my
spirits though. I wanted to like the book, so it wasn't just
that it's not a famous classic like "Disgrace", so I'm not that much
of a book snob. Also, it was really the card that caused me to
buy it, even though I was drawn by the author's name, so it shows
that my instincts are good, which gives me confidence when choosing
books in the future.

The final aspect is the one that makes me happiest though. I know
why it's not a great book. I can point to places in the book and
tell you why they are bad. At school I was terrible in English
classes, I didn't understand the first thing. Reading this book
gave me confidence that I am learning while reading. Not only
learning about life and the world, which I was already concious of,
but also learning about language and writing. Even though I'd
never be able to write like I would like to, I can at least
comfort myself with the knowledge that I am at least able to
partly understand the mechanics of good writing.
