I came across Anthony Raijekov the other day, and was treated to some of his
Trip-Hop, which is outstanding. That was an added bonus though, as I sought him
out to download his Piano track: "Photo Theme: Window Like". You can find him
`on Jamendo`_ and on `ccmixter`_. I would highly recommending going to listen,
and donating via Jamendo if you like what you hear.

This also led me to go back and listen to some new stuff from `Amether`_, who
I found a few years ago thanks to Rob Da Bank. Definitely worth checking out,
especially their remix of "Artisan - Hold my breath".

On the freely available, if not freely licensed side I noticed a new station
from the excellent SomaFM today: `Lush`_. It is said to be "Sensuous and mellow
vocals, mostly female, with an electronic influence," and so far I am enjoying
it though it is rather similar to `Groove Salad`_. I find that I can't keep
SomaFM on all day every day while working though, as I find that it repeats
tracks just a little too often.

I've also been listening a lot to `Ombilikal`_ which covers the harder edge
very well, with some breaks, drum and bass, and dubstep amongst other things.

While in Barcelona I had the pleasure of meeting `Karl Fogel`_ (and hearing
him play, which was a treat), and talking a bit about free content. He
explained to me some of the things that they are trying to do with
`QuestionCopyright.org`_, and some of their methods. It's great to see more
projects working on the issue in a very constructive manner, and I hope that
they succeed. So that we can have many more artists like Anthony Raijekov
that I can discover and reward for their work more directly.
