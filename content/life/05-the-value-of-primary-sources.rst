I recently finished reading `"All Art is Propaganda"`_ by George Orwell,
a collection of some of his critical essays. It was a fascinating read,
and would recommended it. Each of the essays is thought-provoking and
enlightening, and the topics covered are numerous and varied.

The most interesting feature of the book though wasn't the subject matter
of the essays, but the organisation of them. The editor decided to put them
in chronological order, meaning that you see some development of ideas
over the essays, and different topics rise and fall in prominence.

While that's certainly not novel, the effect of structuring the book
in this way was very noticeable in this case for me. I saw a lot of
parallels to the impressions I've had from following `@RealTimeWWII`_
on twitter. This account is "live tweeting" the Second World War as
if it were happening today (currently in 1940).

This artifice brings a whole fresh appreciation of this period that I
have learnt so much about. Consuming the events at the pace they occured
gives time to reflect on each one, and forgetting that I know the
events that followed allows one to get a greater understanding of what
it would have been like to live at that time. The time-compressing
effect of looking back tends to obscure the uncertainty and fear of that
time, the slowness with which some events were unfolding accentuating it.
Consuming this via twitter, with its headline-like format mixing in
with the news of today, heightens this effect.

While it's something of a loss that we aren't able to know what Orwell
would say about the events of today, or what he would have changed in
these essays with the addition of hindsight, there's an undeniable
value in reading this primary source. While hindsight adds, it also
takes away, blurring memories and changing perspectives. Reading the
essays allows you to pick up on the thinking of those living through
the events that we think we know so well.

For instance Orwell seemed to believe that Soviet Russia was a greater
threat than Nazism. The essays in the book run from 1940 to 1949, and 
there are many more words devoted to the Soviets than the Nazis throughout.
His writing suggests that he thought the techniques the Soviets used to
achieve and maintain power were less well known and understood, and would
be more effective over a long period.

After better understanding these benefits I plan to redouble my efforts
to choose books from a varied set of sources, including from different
times, and avoid falling in to a trap of thinking that more recent must
be better as knowledge is always on the increase.
