<p>
After a <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/06/msg01288.html">
discussion</a> <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/07/msg00034.html">on</a> 
the debian-devel mailing list about having a system for unifying the way 
packages create SSL certificates, a couple of things became apparent. Firstly 
that the idea was a good one, and secondly that the existing tool that tries 
to do this (<a
href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/s/ssl-cert.html">ssl-cert</a>) is not <a
href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?src=ssl-cert">good
enough</a>.
</p>

<p>
So I decided that I could do better and started writing the next generation of
the tool. This version aims to have different modes of operation, and allow
the system admin the choice of how certificates should be handled. As an added
bonus it makes it easier for package maintainers to create and use SSL
certificates.

<p>
You can see an overview of the design, and the current status of the work <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/SslCertificateHandling">here</a>. There is also 
the source code of the project in a <a 
href="http://jameswestby.net/bzr/ssl-cert2/">bzr branch</a>. I would welcome
any comments that anyone has on the design of the project, as I am sure I
haven't thought of every situation yet.
